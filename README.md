# Thank you very much for reviewing my assignment.

For this assignment, user.jsx coponents is used which displays users fetched from the apiEndpoint. Also, it provides the form with two input fields 'name' and 'email' to add the new data.

In my approach, to keep tha application simple, I kept the components like form, input, label and buttons in same user.jsx component.

In another way, I also created two more components 'userForm.jsx' and'input.jsx' to show how the components could be recactored into different files and then loaded into parent component 'user.jsx'.

# Frontend Applicant Test

Use this repository to create a simple app, with the following features/details, that paginates a list of users. Usage of React Hooks & ES6+ language features, when appropriate, is encouraged.

### Instructions / Details

- Create a public repo on GitHub/BitBucket with the source code from this repository
  - To download this repo: `git clone https://bitbucket.org/appsintegrations/react-frontend-applicant-test.git`
- Design is not taken into consideration but feel free to make it look nice if you wish.
- Please do not spend more than 4 hours on this.
- When finished, email us the link to the public repository.

#### Part 1

- Fetch the users from [this endpoint](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
- Output an, alphabetically sorted, paginated list of users, displaying each user's name. There should be no more than 5 users listed at a time.
- Add two buttons called 'Previous' and 'Next', that, when clicked, paginate the list forwards or backwards.
- When on the first page, the 'Previous' button should be hidden. When on the last page, the 'Next' button should be hidden.
- Color the user's name green if their email address is from a .biz TLD.

_Example:_ If there are 25 users, there would be 5 pages, each containing 5 users.

### Part 2

- Add a form below the paginated list with two input fields, one for name and one for email.
- Also include an "Add User" button.
- Clicking the "Add User" button should insert the form values, as a new user, into the list and reset the form values.
- The user should be inserted into the correct, alphabetical, position within the list.
- The form should be validated prior to adding the new user.
  - The name field requires a first and last name to be valid.
  - The email field requires a valid email for it to be valid.
  - If either field is invalid, the user should not be able to add the user.
  - Display an error if an input is invalid.
